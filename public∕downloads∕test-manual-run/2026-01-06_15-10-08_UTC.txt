Boston Dynamics unveiled Atlas in Las Vegas, a fully electric humanoid robot with no hydraulic systems. 

It runs on a four hour battery that the robot can swap on its own, allowing continuous operation. 

Atlas is highly agile and built for both industrial and household tasks. It is hard not to see how this kind of robot could also be adapted for military or police use.
