ASML builds the machine that quietly sits behind almost every smartphone on the planet, meaning that nearly every modern chip today comes from a system that was physically assembled in a single facility.

@casper_mebius from @veritasium got an extremely rare look inside that machine. It is ASML’s EUV lithography system, which costs around €350 million, pulls in components from roughly 5,000 suppliers, and is shipped in hundreds of crates by plane and truck due to its size and precision.

Every company making the most advanced chips depends on it, including TSMC, Intel, and Samsung, since there is no alternative and ASML controls the entire EUV market.

The first working prototype in 2006 could process just one wafer every 23 hours, while today’s machines reach around 200 wafers per hour after more than 30 years of development, a race that competitors like Canon and Nikon eventually walked away from.

Inside the machine, 50,000 droplets of molten tin per second are hit with lasers to create plasma hotter than the sun, emitting extreme ultraviolet light that is guided by mirrors made by Zeiss, often described as the most precise surfaces ever produced.

Without this process, modern smartphones, AI chips, and advanced processors simply would not exist.

What are your thoughts on this? 🤔💬
