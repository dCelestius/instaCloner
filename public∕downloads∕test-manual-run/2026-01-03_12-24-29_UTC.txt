👀 ChatGPT was asked to recreate the same image 200 times without changing anything, using the exact same prompt every single time. 

Even so, small differences began to appear as the generations went on, with subtle changes in details, proportions, and textures.

Generative AI doesn’t truly copy images, it interprets them, and even under strict instructions a bit of variation slowly creeps in. Perfect one to one replication sounds easy in theory, but in practice it’s much harder than it looks.
