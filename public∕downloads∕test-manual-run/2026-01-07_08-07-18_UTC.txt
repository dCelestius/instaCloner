AI filmmaker @pjacefilms created a Legend of Zelda fan trailer in 5 days on a $300 budget and shared his full workflow.

1. He started by changing the tone, moving away from the bright Nintendo look and planning a darker, more grounded story with clear emotional beats.

2. He mapped out iconic Hyrule locations and built a quick mood board so the scenes would stay consistent.

3. For image generation, he used Nano Banana Pro inside Freepik, relying on character, style, and object references and sticking to 2x2 grids to keep lighting and angles consistent.

4. He generated around 10 to 20 grids per scene, cropped the best shots, and arranged them in Figma to make everything feel cohesive.

5. The selected images were then upscaled in Freepik using Nano Banana Pro.

6. He animated the scenes using Kling 2.6, focusing on clear physical actions, handheld camera movement, and camera shake to sell realism.

7. He finished the trailer with orchestral music and custom sound design.

What used to take months and massive budgets can now be done in days by a single creator, with a few hundred dollars. And this is likely just the beginning...
