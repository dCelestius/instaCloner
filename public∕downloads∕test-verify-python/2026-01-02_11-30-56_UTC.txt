🤯 T800 is now patrolling with police in public in China.

In Shenzhen, a humanoid robot known as the T800 was seen walking side by side with armed police officers during a regular patrol, blending into a busy public space instead of being kept behind barriers or presented as a tech showcase. The robot is built by EngineAI and appeared at Window of the World, one of the city’s most visited tourist locations.

What stood out was how ordinary the scene looked. People noticed, filmed, and moved on, with no signs of panic or disruption. A humanoid robot walking next to police already felt normal enough to pass without much reaction.

This is no longer about futuristic videos or lab tests. It already happened in public, surrounded by everyday life.
