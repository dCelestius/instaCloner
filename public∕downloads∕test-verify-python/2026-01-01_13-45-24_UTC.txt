Exactly how I imagined it when I was a kid 🤯

@enigmatic_e uses a new AI workflow that lets you animate movement by manually shifting objects or images in a scene. It finally makes AI video feel controllable. With a stick, of all things.

They first show the AI how something should move, using a simple video or rough animation. The AI tracks that movement and removes anything that should not be visible.

Then the AI recreates the scene, keeping the movement accurate and the background clean.

A short text prompt describes what is happening, and the final video is generated.
