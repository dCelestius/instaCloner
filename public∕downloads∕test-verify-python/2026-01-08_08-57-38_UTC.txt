There’s a tear in my eye 🥲

Video editor @braginfilm shared a video that hit a lot of people right in the feelings.

Using AI and 3D, he created reunion scenes between iconic characters like Sullivan and Boo from Monsters Inc, Lilo and Stitch, Masha and the Bear, and Sid with the baby from Ice Age.

He even added a note in the comments:

“I hope this video not only brings tears to your eyes, but also gives you a reason to call the people you love. Sometimes we do that less than we should.”

That one hurt a bit.

Did it get you emotional too? 🤔💬
